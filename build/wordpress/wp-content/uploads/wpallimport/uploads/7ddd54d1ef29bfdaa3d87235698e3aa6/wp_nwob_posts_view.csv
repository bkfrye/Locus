<strong>Raleigh, N.C., April 10, 2017 —</strong><a href=\"http://127.0.0.1:3020/\"> Locus Biosciences</a> is excited to announce the addition of its newest Science Advisory Board members, Dr. Casey Theriot and Dr. Daniel Pomp.

<strong>Dr. Casey Theriot </strong>is an Assistant Professor at North Carolina State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine in the Department of Population Health and Pathobiology. Her work focuses on infectious diseases and how antibiotics can alter gut microbiota and metabolome allowing <em>Clostridium difficile</em> to colonize the gut. Representing some of the most advanced work in the field today, Casey’s research involves identifying the role of the gastrointestinal tract microbiome and metabolome in shaping colonization resistance against <em>C. difficile</em>. She also studies the physiology and pathogenesis of <em>C. difficile</em> and the metabolism of bile acids by the indigenous gastrointestinal microbiota.

“Casey has developed some of the most advanced and clinically-relevant <em>C. difficile</em> research models available globally,” said Rodolphe Barrangou, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer and Chair of the Science Advisory Board. “These models can accurately predict how the microbiome will react to existing and new drug treatments, for both the initial onset and recurrence of CDI throughout the human gut. We are thrilled to have Casey on the team and are excited to work together on Locus’ <em>C.</em> <em>difficile</em> antimicrobial product in the coming months.”

<strong>Dr. Daniel Pomp</strong> is a Research Professor in the Department of Genetics (School of Medicine) and Nutrition (School of Public Health) at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill. He has more than 30 years of experience in the genetics and genomics space as applied to biomedical and agricultural sciences. His group was the first to demonstrate that host DNA can control composition of the mammalian gut microbiome. In 1998 Daniel co-founded GeneSeek, a privately held, global biotechnology company dedicated to providing high quality DNA testing to agribusiness and veterinary medicine. After helping grow GeneSeek into one of the world’s leading animal genotyping companies, Daniel sold the business to the Neogen Corporation.

“Daniel has a wealth of experience and expertise in advancing discovery technologies into industry applications,” said Paul Garofolo, Chief Executive Officer for Locus Biosciences. “His entrepreneurial background, coupled with deep knowledge of the growing microbiome industry uniquely positions Daniel to advise our team, and we look forward to exciting times ahead as we work together to discover new microbiome drug applications.”

6150,1,"2017-07-10 10:28:39","2017-07-10 14:28:39","<strong>Research Triangle Park, N.C., July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ </strong>– Locus Biosciences Inc. today announced the closing of a $5m Convertible Note to support the development of CRISPR-Cas3 antimicrobial therapeutics. Financing for the round was led by Tencent Holdings Limited, a leading Chinese Internet services provider, and joined by the North Carolina Biotechnology Center. This funding will advance multiple infectious disease product programs targeting antibiotic resistant infections and other microbiome-related diseases.

Founded by Dr. Rodolphe Barrangou and Dr. Charles Gersbach, Locus Biosciences designs and creates novel antimicrobial applications which leverage the powerful CRISPR-Cas3 system that kills target bacteria by irreversibly destroying the bacterial DNA. Unlike efforts to use CRISPR-Cas9 and other technologies to edit the human genome, Locus is taking advantage of the unique properties of CRISPR-Cas3 to target and eradicate specific bacterial populations. Locus believes this technology is a catalyst for new infectious disease and microbiome therapies while simultaneously addressing the challenges coupled with broad-spectrum antibiotics and the selection for antibiotic resistance.

Locus Biosciences is using CRISPR-Cas3 technology to target antibiotic resistant infections without risks associated with targeting human cells. “Our novel CRISPR-Cas3 approach to precision antimicrobials works by commandeering a bacterial cell immune system present in many bacteria, so we never modify human cells,” said Rodolphe Barrangou, PhD., CSO of Locus Biosciences. “This makes our technology ideal for addressing pathogenic targets throughout the microbiome while avoiding currently known antibiotic resistance mechanisms and leaving non-target bacteria and human cells unharmed.”

Scientists at Locus Biosciences are now advancing their work with CRISPR-Cas3 to develop antimicrobials to take on diseases such as <em>C. difficile </em>and <em>CRE </em>infections. “As the only company in the world using CRISPR-Cas3 enzymes to kill targeted pathogens, we believe Locus could have the world’s most powerful mechanism of action to drive programmed cell death in bacterial targets,” says Paul Garofolo, CEO of Locus Biosciences. “Not only could this technology revolutionize the way we treat multi-drug resistant infections in patients, but it could also catalyze a novel and powerful approach to changing the human microbiome.”

Scientists around the world are raising the alarm that we are entering a post-antibiotic era, in which all currently-available antibiotics are ineffective.  Since its founding in 2015, Locus Biosciences has been tackling this problem by developing powerful CRISPR-based “smart bombs” that kill antibiotic-resistant superbugs by irreversibly destroying the bacterial DNA. Locus is the only company in the world utilizing CRISPR-Cas3 to kill targeted pathogens, such as <em>Clostridium difficile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>and <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>.

&nbsp;

“The possibilities with the CRISPR revolution inside biotech are limitless, and not just tied to the human genome,” said Stuart Peterson, President of ARTIS Ventures. “The potential behind what Locus is working on is exactly the type of innovation that we have built our investment portfolio around and we are confident that Locus is making great progress on removing deadly pathogens from the human body.”

&nbsp;

“Other companies are developing CRISPR applications to modify the human genome, but we are concentrating our efforts on removing deadly pathogens from the body,” said Paul Garofolo, Founder and CEO of Locus Biosciences. “As our technology targets antibiotic resistant infections without risk to human cells, we can rapidly develop new infectious disease and microbiome therapies that avoid the risks posed by broad-spectrum antibiotics and their selection for antibiotic resistance.”

<strong>Research Triangle Park, N.C., and San Francisco, January 3, 2018 </strong>– Locus Biosciences, Inc., and IDbyDNA, Inc., announced today a partnership to develop a diagnostic test to identify the presence of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> (<em>P. aeruginosa</em>) in patient samples.  Based on IDbyDNA’s Explify™ Next Generation Sequencing clinical metagenomic technology platform, Locus intends to use this test for patient selection and evaluation in clinical trials of LBx-PA01, a CRISPR-based precision antimicrobial product targeting <em>P. aeruginosa</em>.

LBx-PA01 leverages CRISPR-Cas3 technology to precisely eliminate <em>P. aeruginosa</em>, including multidrug-resistant strains identified as a “<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/index.html\">Serious Threat</a>” by the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/hai/organisms/pseudomonas.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), in patients suffering from pneumonia and other diseases caused by this common pathogen.  The companion diagnostic test developed through the Locus-IDbyDNA collaboration will allow Locus to quickly identify patients who are likely to benefit from treatment with LBx-PA01, increasing the probability of successful clinical trial results.  Once LBx-PA01 reaches the market, the test will ensure that the medication will be given to patients with the greatest opportunity to benefit from it, improving patient outcomes and reducing the overall cost of treatment.

The Explify platform utilizes DNA and RNA sequencing and Taxonomer, IDbyDNA’s proprietary ultra-fast DNA search technology, to quickly identify pathogens by their genetic signatures. This novel approach can identify pathogens that are often missed by conventional methodologies.

“We are excited to collaborate with IDbyDNA, which has one of the world’s leading platforms for identifying specific microbes in patient samples,” said Paul Garofolo, Chief Executive Officer of Locus. “This test will enable Locus to precisely target LBx-PA01 to the patients who are most likely to benefit.”

“We are pleased that Locus selected IDbyDNA for this important development project,” said Guochun Liao, Chief Executive Officer of IDbyDNA. “Our technology is well-suited to the precise identification of <em>Pseudomonas</em> infection in target patient populations.”

According to the CDC, serious <em>Pseudomonas</em> infections – such as infections of the blood, skin, lungs, catheters and surgical sites—usually occur in hospitalized people and those with weakened immune systems and can lead to severe illness or death.  Though these infections are commonly treated with antibiotics, many are becoming more difficult to treat due to increasing antibiotic resistance.

<strong>Research Triangle Park, NC, and Union City, CA; July 17, 2018 </strong>– Locus Biosciences Inc., an emerging biotechnology company developing CRISPR-Cas3-engineered precision antibacterial products, announced today its acquisition of EpiBiome, Inc.’s high-throughput bacteriophage (“phage”) discovery platform. Pairing EpiBiome’s powerful phage isolation and characterization capability with Locus’s CRISPR-based synthetic biology platform and clinical development team creates a combined entity that is rapidly developing products to treat antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections and precisely edit the microbiome. Terms of the deal are undisclosed.

Locus is the world leader in CRISPR-engineered phage therapeutics, uniquely leveraging the powerful Type I CRISPR-Cas3 system to specifically destroy the DNA of target bacteria cells, quickly killing them. This DNA-shredding technology is the most potent mechanism of action for driving programmed cell death using CRISPR and is functionally distinct from the better-known Cas9 systems used in gene editing. Locus is the exclusive global licensee of the foundational CRISPR-Cas3 patent estate from North Carolina State University and Duke University.

<u>An Emerging Global Crisis </u>

Phage have been used to kill bacteria for more than 100 years but fell out of favor when highly effective antibiotics were developed in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. However, abuse of antibiotics in agriculture and their over-prescription in medicine is creating a global crisis through the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance. Scientists around the world are sounding the alarm that we are entering a post-antibiotic era in which all currently available antibiotics will soon be ineffective. This crisis has renewed interest in phage therapeutics.

Locus’s CRISPR-Cas3-engineered phage (“crPhage”) platform has the potential to revolutionize the way antibiotic products are developed by combining the extraordinary human safety profile of phages with the efficacy advantage of CRISPR. crPhage products kill target bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant superbugs, while leaving the many species of good bacteria in the body unharmed. The acquisition of EpiBiome’s automation platform helps Locus develop these crPhage products much more rapidly.

This advancement in technology is crucial, as many large pharmaceutical companies have exited the antibiotics market due to the time, prohibitive costs, and risk related to developing new antibiotics. Furthermore, when a powerful new class of antibiotics does make it to market—an exceedingly rare event today—doctors and health systems often hold it in reserve to treat only those patients who don’t respond to anything else. With Locus’s approach, the time, cost, and risk are reduced and there is no need to hold back effective products, making crPhage product development much more appealing than traditional antibiotic development to large pharmaceutical companies.

“EpiBiome built the world’s most effective automated platform for finding novel therapeutic phages,” said Paul Garofolo, CEO of Locus Biosciences. “Adding this high-throughput screening, genomics, and bioinformatics platform to the front end of our synthetic biology pipeline significantly accelerates our engineering of new phage products targeting specific bacterial populations, reducing the time to IND for new programs to as little as 12 months. We also expect to complete clinical development in less than half the time of traditional antibiotics.

“We’re proud of the one-of-a-kind high-throughput phage discovery platform that EpiBiome built – it has allowed us to create phage cocktails targeting a broad array of human pathogens effectively tackling the challenge of antibiotic resistance,” said Dr. Nick Conley, co-founder and chief science officer of EpiBiome.

“We are thrilled to partner with Locus, a world-class phage engineering company, to improve efficacy levels beyond what natural phages can achieve and to secure the intellectual property protection demanded by strategic partners,” added co-founder and CEO of EpiBiome, Dr. Aeron Hammack.

In addition to strengthening its phage discovery platform, this transaction adds additional assets to the Locus development pipeline including a <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> program and assets targeting other ESKAPE pathogens, which are the leading causes of nosocomial infections globally. The acquisition also enhances Locus’s ability to develop phage cocktails to address dysbiosis in the human microbiome, which will enable Locus to rapidly tackle large-market indications such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer.
